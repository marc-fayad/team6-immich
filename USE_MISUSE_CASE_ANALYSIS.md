## 1. Operational Context

This analysis builds upon the operational environment established in our project proposal for Immich. The system of interest is a self-hosted Immich deployment used by a five-person photography studio to manage, store, and share photos and videos.

### 1.1 System and Trust Boundaries

The security analysis considers interactions across the following system and trust boundaries:

- Internet
- Reverse proxy
- Immich application
- PostgreSQL database
- File storage
- External identity provider, where applicable

The PostgreSQL database and file storage are treated separately because the database contains application metadata and authentication-related information, while original photos and videos reside in file storage.

## 3. Consolidated Security Requirements

The following table consolidates the functional security requirements derived from the five misuse-case analyses and maps them to the threats and security controls that motivated them.

| ID | Security Requirement | Derived From | Security Property / Control | Immich Support | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SR-AUTH-01 | TBD | Authentication/Login | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SR-ASSET-01 | TBD | Private Asset Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SR-SHARE-01 | TBD | Shared Links | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SR-ADMIN-01 | TBD | Administrative Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SR-OIDC-01 | TBD | OAuth/OIDC | TBD | TBD | TBD |
